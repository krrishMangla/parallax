            <h2>Parallax Scrolling effects</h2>
            <p>Parallax scrolling effect is a technique where the background of a website scrolls at a slower
               pace than the foreground.
               The purpose is to achieve an illusion of depth within the 2d scene of a website.
               Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a
               slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the
               site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.
               Parallax is based on optical illusion
